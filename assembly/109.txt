修正しました。

以下のプログラムを109.sとして保存した。

.globl puts_twice
puts_twice:
    mflr %r0
    std %r0,16(%r1)
    stdu %r1,-112(%r1)
#スタック上にポインタを保存しておく。
    std %r3,64(%r1)
    bl puts
    nop
#スタック上からポインタを読みだす。
    ld %r3,64(%r1)
    bl puts
    nop
    la %r1,112(%r1)
    ld %r0,16(%r1)
    mtlr %r0
    blr

以下のプログラムを109.cとして保存した。

#include<stdio.h>

void puts_twice(const char *s);

int main(){
    char s[1000];
    while(~scanf("%s",s)){
        puts_twice(s);
    }
    return 0;
}

以下のテストケースを109testとして保存した。

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaajjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj

以下のコマンドを実行した。

gcc 109.c 109.s -o 109
./109 < 109test

実行結果は以下。
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

改行も含めてちゃんと二回出力されているようである。
